# Plane and Helicopter Rental Hub Data

## 🎯 The Goal
You are a data analyst intern for a private plane and helicopter rental company. For your first assignment, your new manager has tasked you with creating multiple dashboards to present at a company meeting. Specifically, you are required to use the provided FAA datasets to determine the best locations to set up new rental hubs.

Your manager wants the answer to the following questions:

- Which states and cities have the most airports with heliports?
- What is the facility type breakdown for the states with the most airports?
- What are the airports and states with the highest percentage of flight cancellations with over 10,000 flights?
- Where are the busiest, joint-use major airports that have control towers and what are their associated codes?
- What are the origin and destination airports with the smallest average distance between them?

I'll add more business questions after having an understanding of the underlying data model.
